Nice 👏 that’s a great project to showcase. A good `README.md` will make it look professional and easy for others to run. Here’s a template tailored to your **Spring Boot + Fetch API frontend + JUnit tests CRUD Task Manager** project:

---

👉 Do you want me to also create a **sample `index.html + script.js` frontend code snippet** (with fetch calls for your endpoints) so your README looks more practical?
